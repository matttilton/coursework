What Operating systems do
    Resourece allocation
        decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair resource use
    Control program
        controls execution of programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer

bootstrap program
    stored in rom or eprom - firmware
    initializes system
    loads operating system kernel and start execution

io and cpu work concurently
every io device has its own controller
each controller has a local buffer
cpu moves data between buffers and memory
io is from the device to local buffer of controller
device controller informs cpu that it has finished its operation by triggering an interrupt
