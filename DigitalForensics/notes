Types of data extracted
    file system data
    content data
    metadata
    filename data
    application data

types of data Analysis
    file and application Analysis
    hidden data Analysis (slack space, host protected area, steganography)
    time frame Analysis

antiforensics - sabotaging ivestigation
    - data forgery (change timestamps, change data)
        - changing data to make it look like the crime was not commited
    - data destruction (physical and logical deletion)
        - degause
    - data hiding (encryption, obfuscation)
        - hide data in slack space   
        - falsly mark bad sectors and put data in them
    - analysis prevention
        - dont leave a trace behind
        - syscall proxing
            - using a kernel on a different computer to make system calls
        - thread hijaking
            - using a different process to run your process. often on a different computer.
        - key scramblers
            - anti keylogger
            - encrypts the key presses at the driver level
        - full disk encryption
    - online anonymity
        - ip traceback - analysis Techniques
            - finding the source of a packet.
        - proxy
            - dont use transparent proxy
                - doesnt hide ip
            - anonymous proxy is ok
                - still apears as a proxy server
            - elite proxy is best
                - doesnt tell the server that it is a proxy server
        - vpn similar to proxy
            - proxies dont encrypt the request between the proxy and you
            - vpns have full e2e encryption on all packets between you and them
