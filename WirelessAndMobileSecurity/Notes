4 main mobile security concerns
    device loss/theft
    application security
    device data leakage
    malware
Evolution of Data networks
    from telegraphy to packet switching
    what made circuit switching different from packet switching
Mobile networks
    1G
        AMPS
        Vulnerabilities
    2G
        CDMA/GSM
        Intro of SMS
    3G
        mobile ip broadband
    4G/LTE
        All-IP mobile network
Core Principle of network and data security (CIA Triad)
    Confidentiality -- make sure that no one can see who is doing what -- ensure using encryption
    Integrity -- make sure that the data is what you think it is -- ensure using hashing
    Availability -- make sure that you can access the data when you need it -- 
    information security uses the same principles +2 extra
        Accountability -- users responsible for thier actions
        non-repudiation -- make sure that the log is accurate
OSI Model
    All People Seem To Need Data Processing
        physical
        datalink
        network
        transport
        session
        presentation
        application
    what are the functions of the individual layers
    what are the data units of the lower layers
        physical -- bits/bytes
        datalink -- frames
        network -- packets
IPv4 vs IPv6
    IPv6 is not fully roled out because you need to replace the hardware
WiFi protocols
    supports both 2.4 and 5Ghz networks
    IEEE 802.11
        B,g,n,ac
WEP - wired equivalent privacy/wireless encryption protocol
    64-bit and 128-bit
    understand Vulnerabilities/problems/"why its trash"
    RC4
    CRC-32 error check
        40-bit IV
    Weaknesses?
WPA
    a "wrapper" over WEP
    TKIP - Temporal Key protocol
    MIC - message integrity check
        Michael Algorithm
    How does it patch holes of WPA
    Authentication
        PSKs - preshared key
        RADIUS - authentication service
        EAP - extensible authentication protocol
            how does it work
WPA2
    AES protocol - advanced encryption standard
    256-bit
    key Hierarchy:
        master key
        pairwise master key
        pairwise transient key
        key confirmation key, key encryption key, temporal key
    CCMP - Counter mode cypher block chain message authentication protocol
preference for wi-fi data protection - list of hierarchy of wifi encryption schemes
data threat category
    data theft
        sniffing/snooping
        malware
        phishing
    device control
        replay attacks
        bluejacking
        bluesnarfing
    system access
        dos
        jamming
        rouge access point
        evil twin
WLAN components
    Radio card, antenna, 802.11 standards
    topology
        infrastructure Mode
        ad-hoc mode
SSID - Service set identifier
    active scanning vs passive scanning
802.11 service sets
    basic service set
    extended service set
    independent basic service set
    mesh basic service set
multipath
WAP
    4-way handshake for association
